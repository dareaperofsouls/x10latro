# x10latro
A funny little project for ONLY vanilla balatro that makes everything have x10 stats. <br>
Still adding more functionalities to other jokers, adding x10 to consumables, etc. <br>
Not all were given x10 stats, especially those that reduces hands and hand sizes that automatically makes players lose. <br>

# Limitations
Unfortunately, the mod modifies the base game stuff, so you can't use x10 with other mods that adds new content but idk I never tried it xd.

# Installation
Click on the green button on the top that says Code and download it as ZIP. <br>
Go to your Mods folder and extract the mod there.
